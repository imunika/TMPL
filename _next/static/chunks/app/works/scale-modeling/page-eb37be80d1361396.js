The coastline of the small island on the floor thus traces a carbon and energy footprint of staggering proportions: currencies from multiple continents comprised of metals mined from still others, sands transported by container ships and trailer-trucks from who knows where, polished rocks from multiple geologic regions, pieces of once-living coral reefs, figurines and horticultural forms created out of the same petrochemicals that persist in landfills and oceans, burnt-out lightbulbs whose expended kilowattage could power a small village for a month.

In a public conversation with Banerjee in the Syracuse University Art Museum in March 2023, she recounted that the type of scale, a pan balance, carries personal associations for her of visiting marketplaces in India with her mother. Certainly, the viewer recognizes ",(0,s.jsx)("i",{children:"A World Lost…"}),"’s pan scale as a commercial one due to the presence of a plastic gold bullion bar in one of its pans. In the context of a sculpture that engages with histories of injustice bound up with enduring practices of ecological harm, however, the pan scale’s commercial associations end up entangled with its more general cultural power to conjure up and conceptualize “justice.” According to a symbolic tradition that endures into the present from ancient Egypt and Greece, a balanced pan scale signifies the dual ethical demand to weigh sides of a case equally and to find punishments that exactly counteract harms. Banerjee’s version of this emblem reads as critique or even parody of this idea. The incongruous objects juxtaposed on her scale’s two pans—on one side: fake gold bullion, ostrich egg, pedestal, glass eyes, and mohair wool; on the other: ostrich egg, feathers, coral, silver-plated bowl, and more mohair—are so blatantly non-equivalent that they do less to prop up balanced exchanges and retributive justice as desirable ideals than to conjure up the accounting manipulations and legal fictions that underwrite most of our fantasies of “balance.” In the context of a sculpture so engaged with the scalar challenges of anthropogenic climate change, a planetary event whose tipping point has already passed, the overall effect is to expose balanced scales as just another outmoded object in a world that teems with cast-off consumer goods and relatively worthless things.
