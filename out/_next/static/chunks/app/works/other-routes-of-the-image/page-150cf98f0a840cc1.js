Orthodox Christians might also object, finding it offensive or disrespectful to their faith as well. But I think there would be something compelling true about this sculpture—and something that gives Banerjee’s work its urgency. Our senses of who we are and where we belong are always and have always been articulated through references to an other, mediated through objects, peoples, and places that we find different than ourselves. When the Ottomans captured Constantinople in 1453, their architectural vernacular and its image of the city shifted as they made sense of being Ottoman in relation to this new capital. When I see Banerjee’s work, I am reminded of the way that the image of the Taj has circulated through so many different routes of desire. What happens when we give up our claims of control and purity? What does the image of that city look like? I’m not sure that there is a single answer and that may be precisely Banerjee’s point.
